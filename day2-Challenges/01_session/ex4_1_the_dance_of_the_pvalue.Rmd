# The Dance of P-values

P-values can be highly variable, even when studying the same underlying effect. Let's explore this through simulation.

Complete the following code to simulate p-values from repeated experiments. This is similar to what was shown by Cummints in the "Dance of the p-values".

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

# Fill the blanks in the following function
# decide on number of observations n and on the effect size

# Function to simulate p-values 
simulate_pvalues_fun <- function(n_simulations = 1000, sample_size = 30, effect_size = __) {   
  
  p_values <- numeric(n_simulations) 

  n_observations = ___
  for(i in 1:n_simulations) { 
    
    # TODO: Generate two groups of data with rnorm()
    # rnorm draws vectors of random values from normal distributions with
    # a specific mean and standard deviation
    group1 <- rnorm(n = n_observations, mean = 0, sd = 1) 
    group2 <- rnorm(n = n_observations, mean = effect_size, sd= 1) 
  
    # Perform t-test 
    test_result <- t.test(group1, group2) 
    
    # store the p-value
    p_values[i] <- test_result$p.value 
  } 

  return(p_values) 

} 

# Run simulation 
p_values <- simulate_pvalues_fun() 

# Create visualization 
ggplot(data.frame(p_value = p_values), aes(x = p_value)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.05, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of p-values across 1000 simulations", x = "p-value", y = "Frequency")

```

Questions:

What proportion of p-values fall below 0.05?

Key Takeaways

P-values show considerable variation even with consistent underlying effects

# Troubleshooting

-   Let us know if this doesnt work.
-   We can use the first hour of each day (Welcome) to troubleshoot
    issues with installation.
-   If you have issues with internet we'll have local copies of packages

# Course description

This workshop offers a hands-on introduction to the concepts and
practices of reproducible science, aimed at enhancing the integrity and
reliability of research. Participants will learn about the importance of
reproducibility, open science, version control (with GitHub),
computational reproducibility, and data management. The program combines
theoretical elements and hands-on exercises, including setting up
reproducible environments, collaborative projects on GitHub, and
creating reproducible analyses with analysis notebooks.

This 3-day workshop will equip participants with the essential tools and
knowledge (e.g. regarding preregistration) to ensure research integrity,
transparency, and reproducibility.

# Access instructions
The workshop will take place in the Maurice Shock Building (MSB). You can find access details [here](https://www.accessable.co.uk/university-of-leicester/access-guides/maurice-shock-building).

MSB 206A and 208A can be found on the second floor. 

# Pre-session instructions 
You would have been emailed instructions. 
They can be found on the GitHub repository as well: https://github.com/DavidSouto/ReproScience-Workshop/

Troubleshooting
* Let us know if this doesnt work.
* We can use the first hour of each day (Welcome) to troubleshoot issues with installation.
*** If you have issues with internet we'll have local copies of packages**

# Course description
This workshop offers a hands-on introduction to the concepts and practices of reproducible science, aimed at enhancing the integrity and reliability of research. Participants will learn about the importance of reproducibility, open science, version control (with GitHub), computational reproducibility, and data management. The program combines theoretical elements and hands-on exercises, including setting up reproducible environments, collaborative projects on GitHub, and creating reproducible analyses with analysis notebooks.

This 3-day workshop will equip participants with the essential tools and knowledge (e.g. regarding preregistration) to ensure research integrity, transparency, and reproducibility.

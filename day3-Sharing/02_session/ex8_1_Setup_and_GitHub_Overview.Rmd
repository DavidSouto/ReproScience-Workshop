Introduction

The goal of this worksheet is to set things up and explore repositories
on the GitHub website

# Setting things up

Setting up a GitHub Account and GitHub Desktop

You can follow this session without the pro version of GitHub, but if
you want to

be able to create private repositories before sharing them with the
world you will need one.

You should already have an account. If you don't you can create a free
account or an education account by picking the “student” option here, it
will work for staff as well. Then sign-in.

Download GitHub [Desktop & install](https://github.com/apps/desktop).

# Getting started

We can start with a repository that you can access
[here](https://github.com/DavidSouto/playground)

This is a screen copy of the **public** repository. Hover over the image
link to see it in the "Source" mode or to view a bigger version of this
image switch to "Visual" on RStudio:

Take a few minutes to explore the different pieces of information that
you can see on the repository website. We are going to focus on the
"Code" tab.

Starting with options on top: Can you figure out what the "pin" does,
"watching", "forking", "Starring".

Next level, what does "master" mean?

Next hover over the "Update index.html". What does this show?

You then have a list of files, next to which you see arcane comments and
then dates. Click on one of them. For instance the "Update index.html".
Do you understand what it shows? What could this possibly mean "\@\@
-7,7 +7,7 \@\@"? Make a comment. What options you see for comments?

Now click on the corner that says "48 commits" (highlighted) to check
the history of changes. You are then able to see what changes I have
made to my playground repository (or repo).

You see a short description of the changes I have made. If you click on
one of them you can see exactly what was changed. You see “+” or “-”
signs by every line indicating whether there was an addition of text or
removal. By hovering your mouse at the beginning of each line you can
also leave comments.

I have made the playground repository so you can feel free to modify it,
fork, clone, etc.

Have a look at the README section. It shows the formatted contents of
the README.md file as we have seen before.

Look at the right-hand side information. You can see contributors.
Information about deployment (more on this later) and the languages
involved.

You can see that this repository is not something I created from
scratch. Go to the *commits* again and start from the bottom. You can
see Vasilios Mavroudis created the website template. I then made changes
to it. I had several choices before me: 

-I could create a "fork" (more
on this later), allowing me to later merge with the main repository.
Aven if I don't plan to merge it can show appreciation of people's work.

-I could also download a copy and create a repository that is unlinked
to the main repository. It still shows who did what. I am doing this
here instead of forking because I can uses it as a playground.

Go to the Vasilios Mavroudi's profile and see his plain-academic
repository. If you want later on to use it for yourself, use the
"forking".

Finally you can click on the license link in the "About" section. Can
you see how the license applies to sharing code? Is it very permissive
regarding sharing? Do you specify the author?

# Editing things

You are not really meant to do the editing of your files on GitHub, but
you can make small tweaks. That's the easy way to contribute to a
repository or change something in your repository. You will be asked to
fork the repository (quick) to be able to make a "pull request" to apply
the change.

Try making a change to the README file by clicking on the pencil on the
top right corner. What happens? What is a pull request? We'll figure
this later on.

You can click on add file as well (top right of code section) and see
what happens.

Next we want to see how to create a repository of our own, fork it
(create a parallel version we can request OR not to join to the original
later on), or clone a repository.

## Glossary

Let's take some time to review the key terms to avoid all confusion later on.

**Repository** or **repo**: This is the folder where you keep your code. You can have a repo on Github or locally, on your computer, which you want to keep in synch.

**Target repository:** The remote repository to which changes are intended to be pushed or pulled.

**Committing**: You do your thing and after a while you decide that you want to record the changes you have made. This is committing and it involves describing the changes.

**Forking**: Making a copy of a remote repository under your account, allowing you to make changes independently. After making changes, you can submit a *pull request* to propose to merging those changes back to the original repository.

**Cloning**: Making a local copy of a remote repository allowing you to work on it offline. This can be done regardless of whether the repository has been forked or not.

**Fetch origin**: When you *fetch origin*, you retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository *without merging them* with your local version. This way you can see changes made before integrating them.

**Push**: You send your committed changes to a remote repository. This updates the remote repository with the changes you've made locally.

**Pull origin**: Locally, you use the pull command to fetch changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local copy to keep everything synchronized.

**Pull request**: You made some changes to a forked repo (basically you are working on a parallel version of the code), then you make a **pull request** to ask to the original repository owner to consider those changes to be incorporated to the original repository.
